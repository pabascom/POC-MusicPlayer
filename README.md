# POC Music Player
## Challenge:
Create a Music player application like Spotify
1. User should be able to make new Playlist and add songs from the saved songs on the device
2. User can play, pause and stop the songs from the Status bar
3. Send a reminder to the user to replay the song after they have paused it after 30mins, even if the app was closed. For Example, “Want to continue listening to the song?” (Use WorkManager/AlarmManager)
